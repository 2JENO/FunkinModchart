### Event Manager
- [X] Fix ease and set overlapping

### ModifierGroup
- [ ] Optimize percent management system as much as it can (working on it)
    - activeMods var
    - percentsBackup var

### ModchartEnvironment (new class)
- [ ] Concept: Be able to use function formats from other frameworks (such as Andromeda's ModManager/Troll Engine or Zoro's Modcharting Tools or even the Mirin Template (maybe)). This would make it easier to port modcharts already made for those frameworks to FunkinModchart, or also for those who are already familiar with those frameworks and would like to make a modchart in FunkinModchart. (working on it)

### ModchartRenderer
- Switch to a custom Graphics instance,
  so we can copy an use it as a actor
  frame (also would be possible to
  transform the entire playfield).
